meeting notes 20210401
----------------------------
can use our sample, old 5ml scale HPLC synergy transfer reaction replicate #1
  - substrate: 3 w/v% low viscosity LBG
  - acceptor: 10 v% allyl alcohol
  - enzyme (beta-man): wt TrMan5A 50nkat/ml
  - enzyme (alga-gal): Aga27A 50nkat/ml
  - Buffer: 50mM NaAc pH 5.0
  - time points: [0 1 2 4 5 8 24]h, final reaction stopped at 24h
  - temp: 40 Â°C
  - aliquots: 150 ul for each time point, for HPLC later on

(data from 1ml incubation available in figure)
----------------------------
NMR experiment

Basel has a pulse sequence for 2D 13C 1H, on 500MHz Bruker spectrometer at CAS
  - coupled 13C experiment using gated decoupling: get J(C1-H1) coupling constant
  - COSY, TOSCY, HMBC, HSQC, NOESY for chemical shift assignment
  - 1D 1H experiment
  - 1D 13C experiment

first look will be of 1H spectrum on 20210409, Monica has booked time for herself
  sample prep: 
    - speed vac to half volume to evaporate allyl-alcohol
    - Freeze dry x2 (Emil A will show me) until complete evaporation,
    - then resuspend in 600 ul D2O both times (available on SB:s bench)
Monica is in lab 20, consider getting NMR lab access beforehand
---------------------------
calculate approximate concentration fo sample extrapolating from 1 ml incubation (1 ml 6h should be used, look for total conjugate concentration)

  ideally 600 ul with 10 mg/ml product, we won't get anywhere close though (we have around 3 mg/ml over 3 species of conjugate).

  Can always increase acq time for better S/N

  Can potentially use new incubation with M4 if this doesn't work

We've booked the 500MHz Bruker NMR spectrometer at CAS 20210423-20210424 for the 2D experiment.
