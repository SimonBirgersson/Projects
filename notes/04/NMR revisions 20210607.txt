M4 incubation
To confirm the bond conformation of the anomeric carbon, 5ml wt incubations were prepared in 50mM sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.0, with substrate 5mM Mannotetraose being loaded at 10mM, and with 10vol% allyl alcohol. the enzyme used was wt TrMan5A, and enzyme load was 50nkat/ml, where the activity was towards LBG and based on results from the DNS assay. the incubation was carried out at 40C and terminated after 4h by boiling for 10min. this was also repeated with allyl-OH missing as a hydrolysis control. 

sample prep
Before NMR analysis, the samples were centrifuged to remove insolubles, then concentrated using Speed-vac to 50% of its original volume to evaporate remaining allyl alcohol before freeze drying and redissolving in 99.8% D2O. This was repeated to remove as much H2O as possible. The remaining 600ul of sample was then analyzed using the Bruker Avance III spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) at 500.17 MHz.

Experimental
13C and 1H spectra were collected at 25C and 45C, with 2D HSQC and HMBC collected as well. Chemical shifts for the proton spectra (δH) were given in ppm relative to the residual internal solvent peak taking into account the temperature dependence25 (HDO, δH 4.70 ppm at 25 °C and δH 4.55 for 45 °C). The 13C spectrum chemical shift scale was obtained using the Bruker software Topspin 4.1.1 pl6 for calculating the unified scale according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC).

NMR spectroscopic analysis:
TrMan5A (50nkat/ml) was incubated 4h in 50mM NaAc pH 5.0 with 10ml M4, 10vol% allyl alcohol. A hydolysis control incubation without allyl-OH was carried out as well. The samples were then centrifuged, concentrated using speed-Vac to 50% original volume, and freeze dried / redissolved in D20 (99.9% Sigma Aldrich) twice to remove excess H2O. NMR spectra were acquired using a Bruker Avance III spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) at 500.17 MHz. spectra were collected at 318.15K in order to avoid the residual water peak. The 1H chemical shifts were referenced according to the XXX signal at YYY. The 13C  chemical shift scale was obtained using the Bruker software Topspin 4.1.1 pl6 for calculating the unified scale according to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Experiments ran were 13C-HSQC, and 13C-HMBC, optimized for 8 Hz, for assignment. The 1JC-1,H-1 scalar coupling constants were determined from the 13C-satellites in a 1D 1H spectrum. the 3JH-1,H-2 scalar coupling constants were estimated from the doublet splitting of the anomeric H-1 signals in the spectrum.

Results:
The TrMAn5A reaction mixture was analysed using NMR. Assignment of the anomeric signals was carried out using 13C and 1H 1D NMR  in conjunction with 2D 13C HSQC and 13C HMBC experiments. There were ~17 shifts identified in the anomeric region (labelled XXX-YYY in fig: S.XXX, tab: S.XXX). Since the sample contains many products with similar chemical environments, a lot of the peaks contain overlapping signals. Two peaks in the region 4.69-4.705 were present in the transfer reaction but not in the hydrolysis control. peak  XXX at 4.704ppm has been shown in previous studies to corresponds to the anomeric proton signal from allyl-beta-mannose  [4]. Both of these peaks show cross peaks in the 13C HSQC connecting to a carbon peak at 98.83ppm (fig: S.XXX), indicating that this is the anomeric carbon signal for both of these peaks. This peak in turn has cross peaks in the 13C HMBC spectrum with two peaks, namely peak XXX (4.37ppm) and peak YYY (4.252ppm) (fig: S.XXX), which corresponds well to assigned shifts for the two protons located on the first carbon of the allyl-group according to previous study [4]. This indicates that the anomeric carbon signal located at 89.83ppm is connected chemically to the proton shifts XXX and YYY. Thus it is believed that the two proton peaks XXX and YYY originate from allyl-mannosyl. 

The anomeric configuration of the allyl glycoside product can be determined by measuring the 1J(C-1,H-1) scalar coupling constant [1]. The scalar coupling for the carbon peak at 98.83ppm was determined to peak XXXHz, indicating a beta-configuration in constrast to 170Hz indicating an alpha-configuration[1]. The 3J(H-1,H-2) coupling constant was measured to be ~0.6Hz and XXXHz, respectively which is in line with beta-configurated oligosaccharides [3]. The assigned shifts are presented in table S.XXX
