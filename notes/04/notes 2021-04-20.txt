NMR analysis
    Mangage to open your spectra in TopSpin
    Read lit that Monica sent

    "I found a temporary workaround for this. If you go to your macintosh HD and press Cmd + Shift + period. It will show hidden files. From there go to Opt->topspin4.0.7, at the bottom of that folder there should be a topspin exec file. If you open that file it will open up topspin through the terminal (native mac app) and the first time you do this it should ask if you want to allow access for terminal to access your file system, press yes/allow and then after that you will be able to use topspin as normal. But if you do it this way it still doesn't change opening topspin normally so you will have to go this route every time"

    "Adding the data folders to the parent folder nmr worked!"

NMR sample preparation
    meet Emil at 10:00, start freeze-drying
    Talk about plan for the rest of the freeze drying process

HPLC sample prepp
    Look through old data and notes for standard curve composition
    prepare std curve
     dilute in ACN and filter samples + std solutions
----------------------------------------------------------------
HPLC sample prepp
    std curve: [0.05 0.1 0.2 0.5 1 2 3] (mM) of allylmannopyrannoside
    prov i duplikat, std i duplikat
