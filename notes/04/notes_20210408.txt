  In this century, humankind has to face the following challenges:
  • Natural resources are finite.
  • Waste production contaminates soils, water, and air—this being a serious risk
  for the environment and our health.

  In the past, waste was often disposed in relatively cheaply landfills or landspreading. However, subsequent to the Kyoto agreement, the issue of waste in our modern society has become more prominent since it contributes to many of the problems of global environmental sustainability.

  Landfill taxes and increasing cost of disposal are driving the industry to new ways of waste management: the most obvious is new processes that reduce both natural resource consumption and waste production. However, large amounts of waste are still produced.

  Once generated, this waste can be a source of serious problems or a source of incomes. A simple way to use agro-industry waste is the use of biomass in low-valuable applications such as compost or animal feed or as source of energy.

  Going further, waste can be use as source for the isolation of highly valuable compounds (such as proteins, carbohydrates, monomers, polyphenols, etc.). In this way, not only the amount of waste ended in landfills is reduced, but also the amount of natural resources required is reduced since these compounds can be used for further industrial production.

  Although the management of waste involves an increase in the production costs that companies have to afford, not all companies are in the situation of carrying out research to reduce the amount of natural resources and/or energy or to increase the value of the waste generated. For small–medium companies the insufficient R&D capability and the lack of markets for new products are a handicap. Moreover, these
  companies may have the perception of an insufficient return of investment. In the case of large companies, with sufficient R&D capability and ability to open or introduce themselves in new markets, the diversification is a risk, and the scheduling of research is too long in some cases.

  In both scenarios, academia is an essential piece in the complex jigsaw of human development. Firstly, it has the possibility of carrying both applied and basic research, the latter being not profitable from a company point of view but being essential as the foundations for further development. Secondly, academia’s scheduling is longer than the one in companies, and therefore they can stay with problems longer, which allow them to face more complicate challenges and carried out long-term research. Thirdly, they can also research in fields of low market return but high human interest as in the case of drugs for rare diseases. And last but not least, academia can supply the lack of facilities and qualified personnel in the small–medium companies.

  Yet, in the past both academia and companies have mainly work in a separate manner. It is clear, specially taking into account the serious reduction of R + D + i budget in companies due to the crisis, that companies have to consider the important contribution that academia can offer them. The role of start-up companies born from academia – as InFiQuS – is to highlight products developed by academia working as a bridge between big companies and applied research. In the field of research in which InFiQuS is involved, the main needs that have been identified with the natural compounds under research are the following:

  • Safety.
  • The biological activity of these compounds needs to be demonstrated by in vivo
  studies and clinical assays.
  • Control the content of the bioactive compounds in the final products.
  • Improvements in chitin and chitosan production.
  • Evaluation of the potential market and price.

  It is of great importance to establish the risk/benefit balance of using these compounds for health-related purposes. Although some of these products have been widely used by folk medicine, both their safety and activity need to be established by in vivo studies and clinical assays.

  This work is fundamental to drive all the questions related to regulatory aspects and can be carried out in a complementary manner by both academia and companies. It is very remarkable that in the case of chitin and chitosan, their biological properties, biodegradability, etc. depend on the physicochemical characteristics of the samples. In the case of academia it is still very usual to find articles in which a poor or nonexistent characterization does not allow to reproduce the claims regarding specific activities. In other cases, such as products isolated from cardoon, their properties are not sufficiently studied. This confusion regarding the real activities of biological compounds plus the lack of control in the commercialized products in which the specific bioactive compounds are only present as traces, and therefore are inefficient for any purpose, is a serious danger for the future of the market since it introduce doubts in the clients regarding

  the benefits of these products. Therefore, a more complete and detailed study of the possible claims associated with these products will be highly beneficial, taking into account that their behavior is associated with their physicochemical characteristics (MW, chemical composition, etc.).
