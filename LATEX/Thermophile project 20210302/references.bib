abstract = {The breakdown of $\beta$-1,4-mannoside linkages in a variety of mannan-containing polysaccharides is of great importance in industrial processes such as kraft pulp delignification, food processing and production of second-generation biofuels, which puts a premium on studies regarding the prospection and engineering of $\beta$-mannanases. In this work, a two-domain $\beta$-mannanase from Thermotoga petrophila that encompasses a GH5 catalytic domain with a C-terminal CBM27 accessory domain, was functionally and structurally characterized. Kinetic and thermal denaturation experiments showed that the CBM27 domain provided thermo-protection to the catalytic domain, while no contribution on enzymatic activity was observed. The structure of the catalytic domain determined by SIRAS revealed a canonical ($\alpha$/$\beta$) 8-barrel scaffold surrounded by loops and short helices that form the catalytic interface. Several structurally related ligand molecules interacting with TpMan were solved at high-resolution and resulted in a wide-range representation of the subsites forming the active-site cleft with residues W134, E198, R200, E235, H283 and W284 directly involved in glucose binding. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The endo-$\beta$-1,4-mannanase from the hyperthermostable bacterium Thermotoga petrophila (TpMan) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of mannan and heteromannan polysaccharides. Of the three domains that comprise TpMan, the N-terminal GH5 catalytic domain and the C-terminal carbohydrate-binding domain are connected through a central ancillary domain of unknown structure and function. In this study, we report the partial crystal structure of the TpMan at 1.45 {\AA} resolution, so far, the first modular hyperthermostable endo-$\beta$-1,4-mannanase structure determined. The structure exhibits two domains, a ($\beta$/$\alpha$)8-barrel GH5 catalytic domain connected via a linker to the central domain with an immunoglobulin-like $\beta$-sandwich fold formed of seven $\beta$-strands. Functional analysis showed that whereas the immunoglobulin-like domain does not have the carbohydrate-binding function, it stacks on the GH5 catalytic domain acting as a thermostabilizing domain and allowing operation at hyperthermophilic conditions. The carbohydrate-binding domain is absent in the crystal structure most likely due to its high flexibility around the immunoglobulin-like domain which may act also as a pivot. These results represent new structural and functional information useful on biotechnological applications for biofuel and food industries.},

In this work, crystals of the catalytic domain of a hyperthermostable endo-1,4-Β - d-mannanase from Thermotoga petrophila RKU-1 were obtained from three different conditions, resulting in two crystalline forms.

abstract = {A novel thermostable mannanase from a newly isolated Bacillus pumilus GBSW19 has been identified, expressed, purified and characterized. The enzyme shows a structure comprising a 28 amino acid signal peptide, a glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5) catalytic domain and no carbohydrate-binding module. The recombinant mannanase has molecular weight of 45. kDa with an optimal pH around 6.5 and is stable in the range from pH 5-11. Meanwhile, the optimal temperature is around 65. °C, and it retains 50\% relative activity at 60. °C for 12. h. In addition, the purified enzyme can be activated by several ions and organic solvents and is resistant to detergents. Bpman5 can efficiently convert locus bean gum to mainly M2, M3 and M5, and hydrolyze manno-oligosaccharides with a minimum DP of 3. Further exploration of the optimum condition using HPLC to prepare oligosaccharides from locust bean gum was obtained as 10. mg/ml locust bean gum incubated with 10. U/mg enzyme at 50. °C for 24. h. By using this enzyme, locust bean gum can be utilized to generate high value-added oligosaccharides with a DP of 2-6.},

abstract = {$\beta$-Mannanases are involved in the conversion and modification of mannan-based saccharides. Using a retaining mechanism, they can, in addition to hydrolysis, also potentially perform transglycosylation reactions, synthesizing new glyco-conjugates. Transglycosylation has been reported for $\beta$-mannanases in GH5 and GH113. However, although they share the same fold and catalytic mechanism, there may be differences in the enzymes' ability to perform transglycosylation. Three GH5 $\beta$-mannanases from Aspergillus nidulans, AnMan5A, AnMan5B and AnMan5C, which belong to subfamily GH5_7 were studied. Comparative studies, including the GH5_7 TrMan5A from Trichoderma reesei, showed some differences between the enzymes. All the enzymes could perform transglycosylation but AnMan5B stood out in generating comparably higher amounts of transglycosylation products when incubated with manno-oligosaccharides. In addition, AnMan5B did not use alcohols as acceptor, which was also different compared to the other three $\beta$-mannanases. In order to map the preferred binding of manno-oligosaccharides, incubations were performed in H218O. AnMan5B in contrary to the other enzymes did not generate any 18O-labelled products. This further supported the idea that AnMan5B potentially prefers to use saccharides as acceptor instead of water. A homology model of AnMan5B showed a non-conserved Trp located in subsite +2, not present in the other studied enzymes. Strong aglycone binding seems to be important for transglycosylation with saccharides. Depending on the application, it is important to select the right enzyme.},

@article{VanRantwijk1999,
abstract = {Glycosidases catalyse the synthesis of anomerically pure alkyl glycosides in one step. In contrast, chemical synthesis of anomerically pure glycosides is circuitous and expensive. Two methodologies are used in enzymatic glycosylation: thermodynamically controlled reversed hydrolysis and kinetically controlled transglycosylation. The advantages and limitations of both approaches are delineated. Glycosidases exhibit broad specificity with regard to the aglycon: in addition to simple alcohols, hydroxy amino acids, nucleosides, ergot alkaloids and cardiac genins are glycosylated. Non- alcohol acceptors such as oximes and thiols also function as substrates whereas pyranoid glycals act as non-natural donors. Glycosidases exhibit absolute selectivity with regard to the stereochemistry at the anomeric centre and show a high degree of chemoselectivity for different hydroxyl groups, e.g., the order of reactivity is primary > secondary alcohols > phenols; tertiary alcohols are unreactive. Chiral primary alcohols are poorly discriminated, but the enantioselectivity towards a hydroxyl group that is directly attached to a (pro)chiral carbon atom is often high. The synthetic utility of glycosidases would be considerably improved if methods could be found for maintaining their catalytic activity in non-aqueous media.},
